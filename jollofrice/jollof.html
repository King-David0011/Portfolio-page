            <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot and saut√© the chopped onions until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the blended tomatoes, bell peppers, and scotch bonnet peppers. Cook the mixture on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes until the oil begins to separate from the sauce.</li>
                <li>Stir in the thyme, curry powder, smoked paprika, and bay leaves. Cook for another 5 minutes to release the flavors.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken stock and season with salt and seasoning cubes. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
                <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch, then add it to the pot. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with foil and a tight-fitting lid, and allow the rice to steam for 20-25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Check the rice occasionally and add a splash of water if it begins to stick. Once the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, fluff with a fork.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with fried plantains, chicken, or fish.</li>
            </ol>
